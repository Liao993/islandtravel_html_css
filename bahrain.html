        <h1>Decision to go Visit Bahrain on Days Off</h1>
        <p>
          In between scheduled flights, sometimes we used to get random days off
          which could be quite long. In one of those days, myself and two of my
          best friends had 4 days off at the same time which rarely happened. We
          decided to make use of this rare opportunity and go somewhere
          together, so we booked tickets to Bahrain which was like an hour and
          10 minutes only from Abu Dhabi by Air. We landed at Bahrain
          International Airport, and we decided to rent a car to have more
          freedom and an easy way to explore it, and then the whole fun began.
          It is actually recommended for any travelers to Bahrain to take the
          option of renting a car because the island is too small, and it is
          easier to go and discover places and roam around with a car than
          taking a taxi which is the other option there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bahrain is a very small beautiful island, and Bahrain in Arabic means:
          The Two Seas. The reason for being named with that name is that there
          are two sources of water there, the sweet and the salty water. Bahrain
          is a very safe place to go out at any time during the day or night.
          People there are very friendly and very helpful. The place kept its
          old heritage sites which include old markets, castles, museums and
          traditional restaurants, and at the same there is a modern part which
          includes modern restaurants, shopping malls and skyscrapers. Bahrain
          is considered one of the 6 Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries ,
          together with Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and
          Qatar. One common feature among those 6 countries is the Arabian
          hospitality, palm trees, Arabian dates, the desert and the hot
          climate. There, you will get to experience the true meaning of Arabia
          which is the Traditional name of the Arabian Peninsula. You can visit
          Bahrain through air travel, cruise ships and if you are located in
          Saudi Arabia you can drive over to Bahrain through a bridge that
          connects them together. Most of the Saudi Nationals visit Bahrain over
          the weekends to change the location and have fun in a nearby
          destination.

        <h1>Old Bahrain</h1>
        <p>
          Bahrain is a very small place, and we realized that 4 days there were
          actually too long. You could basically see everything there in like 3
          days, however we still enjoyed every single moment of those 4 days. I
          recommend that you start seeing Old Bahrain first before going to the
          modern part. The modern parts are similar in all the other 6 Gulf
          countries, and the old heritage sites are what gives each place its
          special identity that talks about its historical background that is
          only relevant to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started by visiting the <b>National Museum of Bahrain</b> which has
          arts, statues and manuscripts that belong to more than 5000 years ago.
          The museum will give an idea about the history of Bahrain which can
          serve as a good start before seeing anything else. It is considered
          one of the main island’s attractions that everyone who visits Bahrain
          must pass by and visit. The museum will take you back to the days
          where the civilization of Dilmun Empire, Tylos started in Bahrain and
          was then followed by Islam later on.
        </p>
        <h4>Images: National Museum of Bahrain (inside) & Qa’lat Al Bahrain</h4>

        <img src="image/Bahrain/NM2.jpg" alt="twin" class="imginwordtwo" />

        <p>
          The next suggested historic place to visit is
          <b>Qa’lat Al Bahrain</b>, and Qa’lat means fort or castle in Arabic.
          It is a UNESCO World Heritage-listed attraction.That place is an
          artificial mound or hill that was formed out of the many human
          occupations that Bahrain had passed through in its history. On top of
          these mounds is a Portuguese fort, which was the reason the whole
          place was referred to as Bahrain Fort or Qa’lat Al Bahrain. During the
          Dilmun civilization era, that site was the capital of Dilmun. There is
          an old lighthouse over the sea there, which is a sea tower now, which
          signifies the importance of Bahrain as a trade route through the sea
          in that region. You can manage to capture spectacular photos on the
          mounds, the fort and by the sea in that marvelous location.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bahrainis were famous for being pearl merchants and pearl traders. It
          was a common industry in the Gulf region before the discovery of oil.
          You can enjoy visiting the traditional
          <b>Bahraini House of Sheikh Isa Bin Ali</b> who was a renowned pearl
          merchant in the old days where you can see the architecture and
          structure of how the old houses were, and its famous wooden carved
          doors. This house is located in a city in Bahrain called
          <b>Muharraq</b> which is a district full of ancient restored houses
          which are nice for a stroll through its narrow ancient lanes,
          especially before sunset when the golden sun rays reflect on them
          giving them a special charm.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          <b>Al Fatih Grand Mosque</b>, is one of the largest mosques in the
          world as it can fit 7,000 people for prayers. You can borrow head
          scarves and abayas (long cloaks or robes) from there, which are
          considered the conservative Muslim women's outfits, and they are
          required to be put on before entering religious Islamic sites. Inside
          the mosque, there is a big dome in the ceiling that is made of
          fiberglass and it is the largest fiberglass dome in the world so far.
        </p>

        <img src="image/Bahrain/BabAl.jpg" alt="twin" class="imginwordthree" />
        <p>
          A visit to <b>Manama Souq</b> is definitely a must, and while being
          there you will also get to see another important site which is
          <b>Bab Al Bahrain</b>. Souq means old market market in Arabic and
          Manama is the capital of Bahrain, and Bab Al Bahrain is the gateway of
          Bahrain, which means the Door to Bahrain if translated from Arabic to
          English. You can basically access the old market through this gate,
          which would be like hitting two birds with one stone. This Souq is
          famous for selling old spices, Arabic perfumes, pearl jewelry and
          carpets. It is an open-air market and you might feel overwhelmed by
          the heat and humidity especially if you are there during the hot
          summer months, however the good note is that you can bargain when you
          purchase anything. The sellers there like to have conversations with
          the tourists and they tend to lower the prices very much to let the
          visitors enjoy and have memorable experiences. The ideal time to visit
          Bahrain or any other gulf region is from November to March, the
          weather is just wonderful and perfect for outdoor venues during those
          months.

        <h1>Modern Bahrain</h1>
        <p>
          It is worth it to see the <b>Manama Skyline</b> which is full of
          dazzling skyscrapers including the famous <b>Twin Towers</b>, which
          have the <b>Bahrain World Trade Center</b>.
        </p>

        />
        <img src="image/Bahrain/Bridge.jpg" alt="twin" class="imginwordthree" />

        <p>
          <b>Amwaj Islands</b>, you can spend 1 full day or two days at these
          groups of small artificial modern islands in Bahrain that have a
          contemporary nature. There you can experience modern cafes,
          restaurants and stay at luxurious hotels with lots of activities and
          entertainment options.
        </p>
        <h4>Images: Amwai Islands (Aritfical Island and Sunset)</h4>

        <img src="image/Bahrain/Amwaj3.jpg" alt="twin" class="imginwordthree" />

        <p>
          <b>Hawar Islands</b>, unlike the artificial Amwaj Islands, Hawar
          Islands are on the edge of Bahrain and located very close to another
          gulf country which is the State of Qatar. It is an uninhabited island
          and you can go and enjoy almost a full day there. It is uninhabited
          because it has rare species of birds and animals that are endangered.
          The animal that most of the tourists visit Hawar Islands for is the
          stunning Arabian Oryx.
        </p>

        <img src="image/Bahrain/Hawar3.jpg" alt="twin" class="imginwordthree" />
        <p>
          Another modern attraction to visit is <b>Beit Al Quran</b>, it is a
          religious place that has a collection of Qurans from so many places of
          the world. There is also a library there that has books and
          manuscripts by famous writers from the Islamic era. Beit Al Quran has
          one of the very first translated copies of the Quran from Arabic to a
          foreign language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shopping malls are also very well known and popular places to visit in
          Bahrain that have modern branded and unbranded merchandise. They are
          excellent places to visit especially if it happens that you would be
          visiting Bahrain in the hot summer months, as they are all
          air-conditioned. Some of the well known malls are
          <b>Bahrain City Center, Seef Mall and Al Alali mall</b>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Bahraini Cuisine</h1>
        <p>
          The Bahraini cuisine is influenced by their neighboring countries
          Persia and India. <b>Machboos</b> is the local traditional dish, it is
          an aromatic rice dish with cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and spices, and
          can be served as chicken, lamb or fish Machboos, and it is topped with
          caramelized onions and mixed nuts. The second famous dish there is
          <b>Ghoozi</b>, which is stuffed lamb with spices and rice. Last but
          not least is the <b>Lamb Shawarma</b> served in toasted pita bread and
          vegetables and sauce. In that region of the world, locals make good
          use of spices and herbs which you can also buy from Manama Souq that I
          mentioned about in old Bahrain.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>The Sense of Islandness in Bahrain</h1>
        <p>
          The concept of Islandness in Bahrain is quite special. It is different
          from warm tropical islands even though Bahrain is one of them. It is
          also not the same as cold water islands. I guess the reason is that
          Bahrain is located in the Arabian Peninsula, which gives it a special
          feeling. In addition to that, what makes Bahrain so incompatible to
          others is its Arabic local people. Bahrain portrays the feeling of
          being in a desert, and being welcomed and taken care of by proud
          Arabic islanders offering their generous Arabian hospitality. You can
          apply the concept of sun, sea and sand there, but it is definitely not
          the prevailing taste. Bahrain has its own magic and charm, and let us
          say we take Maldives as an example since both are sun, sand and sea
          islands. In Maldives, the main objective for tourists is to focus on
          the beach, water, diving, the sun and the resorts over there. However,
          in Bahrain it goes beyond that. You can have a lovely time at the
          beaches over there, but at the same time the fascination part mainly
          relies on the interaction with the Arabian culture, its influence, its
          difference and the Middle Eastern mystical charm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bahraini people are also very proud islanders. They have a special
          connection to Bahrain that no one will understand unless you are
          Bahraini like them. They are also very hard working people who work in
          all the fields and industries in Bahrain. Majority of the Gulf
          countries depend of foreign expats for some jobs such as taxi drivers
          and salesperson, however in Bahrain the first thing you would notice
          is that taxis are being driven by Bahrainis. They work in all the
          fields with passion and pride that contributed in making the Bahraini
          Islanders’ identity so strong. I would describe my personal experience
          in Bahrain as visiting a sand, sea and sun island with a warm magical
          Arabian twist.
