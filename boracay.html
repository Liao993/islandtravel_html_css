        <h1>Inspiration to go visit Boracay</h1>
        <p>
          I used to travel to Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a lot, and
          the flights used to be full of tourists. I had no idea that the
          Philippines had some of the most exotic islands in the world during my
          early flying years. My airline used to fly only to the capital city,
          Manila. I also have a lot of Filipino close friends, and one of them
          is my best friend Maria for many years until now. I started asking
          people back then to find out what is the secret behind visiting the
          Philippines, and why so many tourists go there. I then found out that
          it was because of the stunning islands there. I also used to see a lot
          of brochures and advertisements in Manila about those islands and
          wonderful pictures from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard the name Boracay quite often, as it was so popular. Then I
          decided that I have to go and visit a famous island there, and I chose
          to go to Boracay. My travel companion was Maria, my best friend, and
          we arranged and planned everything together. I still owe Maria a visit
          to Egypt because back then we agreed that she would show me her
          country, and I would show her Egypt afterwards. All this goes back to
          the year 2014, because after that Boracay was shut down for quite some
          time for redevelopment. Therefore, my experience in Boracay was based
          on the old days before its closure, so it might be completely
          different from people who visited it recently.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Other Reasons why I Chose Boracay</h1>
        <p>
          Based on Mariaâ€™s knowledge of her country, she said we should visit
          Boracay as it was a place full of water activities and a lot of
          adventures, and it is perfect to be visited by friends. She also
          mentioned that other islands are spectacular, but mainly for
          honeymooners who just want to relax and have a romantic time, with
          less activities and adventures. To visit Boracay, you have to be a
          healthy and fit person, as the water activities and sports require a
          high fitness level. If you are going to spend your honeymoon in one of
          the islands of the Philippines, Maria is always suggesting Palawan and
          El Nido, which I did not visit myself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>When to visit Boracay and what to bring with you?</h1>
        <p>
          Boracay is best visited from December to April, where it is most of
          the time sunny and perfect for water sports, and very less rain. It is
          a tropical island so it is always warm. Basically, all you need to
          bring with you is tops, shorts, bathing suits and flip flops. People
          are walking in these items day and night. There are also some shops
          there that sell all these things, in case you do not want to bring
          anything with you, and would rather buy everything from there. Of
          course, do not forget your sunscreen, tanning oil and mosquito spray
          as you would definitely need them, however, they sell them there too.
          Regarding bringing money, most of the hotels accept debit and credit
          card payments, however, best advice is to always have some currency
          exchange to Philippine pesos. You can also bring some US dollars if
          finding pesos would be hard to find in your country. If you live in
          the Gulf region, it would be so easy to do that before you head to the
          Philippines, as there are many Filipino expats in that region of the
          world. I also recommend carrying cash whenever you go to restaurants
          or do some water activities for tipping, as tipping is very popular
          there. You can pay everything in cards, however, people would expect
          you to tip them in cash as a courtesy.

        <h1>The Journey to Boracay</h1>
        <p>
          In Abu Dhabi, there are direct flights to the capital Manila which are
          9 hours long. We booked with Philippine Airlines full fare tickets as
          we wanted to feel like tourists, and we did not fly with our airline
          in order not to feel like we were on a duty flight. We had a transit
          in Manila for like 4 hours waiting for our connecting domestic flight
          that would take us to Boracay. The flight to Boracay was very short of
          only 1 hour, and that was through taking a propeller, a small aircraft
          that flies at a very low altitude, and it was quite fun. After arrival
          in Boracay, we had to take a ferry that would drop us on the port
          where our hotel was located. Basically, at that time, Boracay
          consisted of 3 stations or ports where the ferry goes to from Boracay
          airport, according to where people have booked their hotels. Boracay
          had station 1, station two and station 3. They are all on the same
          beach, however each one of them has different standards of hotels and
          services. They are all accessible through walking on the island, for
          example: you can walk from station 1 to station 3 by foot, and vice
          versa. As I said earlier, I do not know how things are different now
          from the year I visited it back in 2014.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Things to do at Boracay</h1>
        <p>
          What surprised me when the ferry dropped us at our station was that
          there are no cars there, so basically you have to walk around most of
          the time, and use the ferry if you would like to get away to some
          other spots, or go back to the airport. I was a bit shocked, because
          we had to drag our suitcases on the sand all the way to the hotel we
          booked there, and the wheels on my suitcase had sand trapped in them
          which annoyed me a little bit. However, once we arrived in the hotel
          and put everything in the rooms, I totally forgot about that and we
          began exploring the place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing you will do the most is walking around and jumping from one
          restaurant or bar to another if you decide not to swim on any day for
          example. You can also relax by the beach especially during
          <b>sunset</b>. Sunset by the beach in Boracay is one of the best
          things you would ever see. Boracay has a lot of
          <b>sailing boats</b> which you can also take a ride in one of them, or
          you can just chill by the beach and watch a large number of them
          sailing on the water under the sunset rays.
        </p>

          class="imginwordthree"
        />
        <p>
          There are a lot of street vendors roaming around people who sell
          <b
            >beach accessories, swimming suits, coconut drinking water, and
            fresh mangoes</b
          >. Some of them also belong to <b>tourism companies</b> and offer to
          give you some water <b>activity packages</b> with cheaper prices than
          those at the hotels. You can also do
          <b>body massage or manicure and pedicure</b>, and they do that on the
          <b>beach loungers</b>, and you get to <b>bargain</b> there on
          basically everything outside the hotels. If they like you and you are
          nice to them, they will reduce the price very low.
        </p>
        <p>
          In regards to <b>mangoes</b>, they are very popular all over the
          Philippines, and they are very famous for it. You can even get dried
          mangoes in some shops. However, on the beach you have to try the
          <b>fresh cut mangoes</b> the vendors sell, and they offer you either
          yellow or green ones depending on your preference, and they offer you
          salt or fish sauce with it. This is the traditional Filipino way of
          eating fresh mangoes.

          class="imginwordthree"
        />
        <p>
          <b>Filipino cuisine</b> is so popular with so many varieties of local
          authentic dishes at the restaurants, and there are also so many
          <b>grocery stores and bakery shops</b> all around the island where you
          can buy snacks if you do not like the food there. Restaurants there
          also offer
          <b>international dishes such as pizza, burgers and fries</b> as well.
          I have only tried two local things which is chicken adobo, and a local
          pastry called <b>pan de coco</b>, and both are very mouthwatering. In
          the grocery shops, they have those crackers which are individually
          packed and called: <b>Skyflakes</b>, you can just throw them in your
          bag and carry them around with you in case of any sudden hunger pangs
          during your beach time activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you decide to do some water activities, you can take some of the
          packages they offer you at the beach for reasonable prices, or you can
          always opt for the option of packages from the hotels which tend to be
          overpriced. The most famous water sports there are taking a
          <b
            >banana boat ride, flying fish, parasailing, diving, snorkeling and
            taking a ride on a sailing boat</b
          >b. As I mentioned earlier, these activities are very strenuous and
          dangerous, and you basically get to do them at your own risk.
          Therefore, if someone is suffering from any medical illness,
          disability or unfit, I would not recommend that at all. Also, do not
          forget to put sunscreen on if you are too sensitive to the sun. I
          remember I was so tanned, almost burned towards the end of my trip.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          At <b>night time</b>, a lot of people are socializing in
          <b>bars, clubs and restaurants</b>, or you can sit by the beach again
          and enjoy the <b>fire shows</b> they do there, they are very popular
          and in high demand over there. Once it is sunset, please do not forget
          to put mosquito spray all over your body, as there are a lot of
          mosquitos over there and it would be very uncomfortable to be bitten
          by them all night. We also bought a bottle of room mosquito spray as
          they tend to enter hotel rooms as well, we used to spray the room when
          we get back from our day activities and before we head out to explore
          the night life on the island.

        <h1>Souvenirs and Gifts to buy from Boracay</h1>
        <p>
          The most iconic gift or souvenir you can get to yourself or to someone
          from there is <b>Puka Shell</b> necklaces and bracelets. They believe
          that puka shells provide good luck, and are also a form of protection
          for sailors in the old days if they wore them. The other thing that
          drew my attention at souvenir shops are <b>Capiz Shell</b> plates and
          trays. You also cannot leave Boracay without buying a
          <b>pearl set of earrings</b> which they are quite well known for, and
          you can get them in many colors. If some of your friends like edible
          gifts, you buy them <b>dried mangoes</b> and they will really thank
          you for that as they are very delicious.
        </p>

        <h1>Islandness in Boracay</h1>
        <p>
          Boracay is a typical example of a sun, sand and sea island. It is full
          of palm coconut trees, warm tropical climate, white sandy beaches and
          interesting marine life. The people there are extremely nice and they
          welcome and take care of the tourists really well. Local people are
          proud of their culture, food, and selling their man made products. You
          will be able to recognize tourists from local people as local people
          are so tanned and sun kissed from being exposed to the sun everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dominant vibes there are vibes of happiness and excitement, as
          everybody is on holidays enjoying their time. Feelings of separation,
          isolation and being on a periphery do not exist there, as people are
          busy enjoying their time, and even if they decide to leave this island
          and go to another one, it is still like paradise all over the place.
          Heading back to capital city Manila is awesome, and full of fun things
          to do. However, I would still believe that if Boracay is being visited
          in the wrong season by mistake, people could experience rainy weather
          conditions, some flight cancellations or ferry delays which would have
          an unpleasant impact on them for sure, unlike when visited in the
          recommended months of the year.
