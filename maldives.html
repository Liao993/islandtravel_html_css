        <h1>Getting a Glimpse of Maldives before Being There</h1>
        <p>
          When I started flying, we used to operate Maldives flights as
          turnaround flights, initially we did not have any layovers there. I
          have always heard about Maldives and its connection to honeymooners. I
          was always hearing or reading that people go and spend their honeymoon
          there, and that Maldives is like paradise, and that it is also very
          expensive. When they scheduled me for the turnaround flight, I was
          kind of excited because I would get to see the profile of the
          passengers going there, and also, I would also see the islands from
          the skies. However, I was also frustrated due to the fact that we
          would go back to Abu Dhabi and not have a layover in that magical
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The passenger profile mainly consisted of honeymooners from the gulf
          region, especially local Emirati newlyweds. They are normally wealthy
          and most of them were seated in premium cabins, i.e. first and
          business class cabins. The flight to Maldives from Abu Dhabi is short,
          around 4 hours going there, and 4 hours coming back. I used to ask the
          passengers sometimes about their plans in Maldives and I got to know
          that it is a quiet and serene place to be. I also found out that the
          population of Maldives are mainly muslims, so it was more convenient
          for the Arab tourists to go there as the food would be Halal, and the
          culture of the local people would be kind of similar. Passengers used
          to tell me about the resorts they booked their trips for, and how many
          days they planned to spend there, and the activities they would be
          doing. Most of the resorts that the passengers booked at were top
          notch resorts, and they booked an average of a full week there. Their
          resorts would consist of small private individual villas with their
          own swimming pool, and a private beach.
        </p>
        <p>
          In regards to the view from the skies, it was marvelous. I was
          speechless when I first saw the view from the top, and usually the
          captain of the flight would make an announcement so that passengers
          would look out of their windows and enjoy the scene. You can see the
          stunning 20 atolls with their vibrant colors, it is a mixture of blue,
          green, emerald and turquoise with very white sandy beaches. We were so
          jealous of the passengers who were going to disembark in Maldives.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>In the Capital City Male</h1>
        <p>
          Our airline had some schedule and route changes and decided that the
          crew would have layovers in Maldives, and of course we were over the
          moon when we heard about that. Everyone started bidding and requesting
          for that flight, so it was really hard to get scheduled for it in the
          beginning. You were considered a very lucky crew member if someone
          called sick from the Maldives operating crew, and they pulled you from
          standby to do that flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got scheduled for that flight a few times enough to taste the spirit
          of Maldives and get an idea of what it is about. Of course, my
          experience is different from the tourists who go there and spend more
          time. The maximum I spent there was 48 hours, and I still got to do
          many things in them. When we landed at the airport, we observed that
          Maldives customs officials are very strict. Importation of alcohol is
          strictly prohibited and they often search your bags, and if they find
          any, they confiscate them and issue a fine. You can still buy alcohol
          though once you get into the country, you just cannot bring it from
          abroad. We arrived in the capital city of Maldives which is called
          Male, and our hotel was located there. The city has a big port where
          ferries go back and forth all the day, and famous resorts send their
          private boats to transport passengers who booked with them to their
          location. Some passengers also get transported to their atolls via
          helicopter trips.
        </p>
        <p>
          People who have the situation like us and happen to be staying in Male
          can arrange trips in one of the resorts to spend a full day there or
          to stay overnight. You can either book it through the hotel or contact
          the resorts and they can pick you up from the port. At that point I
          got to know that actually people who are on budgets can still go to
          Maldives and enjoy, as there are different options of resorts and
          hotel packages that fit people with economic budgets. When we arrived,
          it was almost 3pm which was too late to go to resorts, and we
          postponed that till next morning, so we arranged and booked everything
          that afternoon we landed. At night time, we spent the time in the city
          of Male, which has the local people, schools and hospitals, and we got
          to try some Maldivian dishes there.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a communication problem there in the city as hardly anyone
          spoke English, and the local people were very reserved and quiet. They
          do not mingle with the tourists that much; however they are not rude
          or impolite. They just keep their distance and they will do their best
          to help you if you need it even if there is a language problem. I
          personally did not like the local restaurant experience as the food
          was kind of different for me, and I consider myself a picky eater. I
          concluded that I do not like the Maldivian cuisine after trying food
          in the capital city Male, and also ordering some food from the hotel
          we stayed at, as well as the food in the resort we booked for the next
          day. I also entered a convenience store to buy some snacks such as
          chips and chocolates and I did not like them at all. The only thing
          that I really liked there is fresh tropical fruits, they were really
          delicious. They also sell some imported products but they are way too
          expensive, and the tap water there is desalinated and safe to drink
          but it does not taste that good. I had to buy bottled mineral water
          which was also very expensive. We were provided with two complementary
          water bottles in the hotel rooms, however I had to buy more and they
          were costly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maldives has tropical warm weather all year, and the best season to
          visit Maldives is between November and April, as it is away from the
          monsoon season. We were warned by the hotel about our trip the next
          day, that in case the weather gets bad we might be stuck on the island
          that has the resort. I heard that some flight attendants of some
          airlines got fired because they went to a resort, and could not come
          back before their scheduled flight, as they were stuck on an island,
          which caused a very bad reputation for the airline. Imagine passengers
          would go to the airport ready for the flights and the crew to operate
          the flight were absent and stuck on an island
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Embudu Village Resort</h1>
        <p>
          Whether you decide to stay at the hotel in the capital city of Male or
          decide to explore other resorts, you would still have a fabulous time.
          Most of the hotels in Male have sea-water swimming pools as most of
          the hotels are very close to the port, and they have normal swimming
          pools as well. In the evenings, you can have a chilled time at the
          hotel buffet or bar. Nightlife in Maldives is not that popular as the
          destination itself is for couples to enjoy a quiet and a private time,
          and also the local people are mostly conservative religious muslims
          and the majority of them do not drink alcohol or party at night. There
          are nightclubs and bars of course, however they are not the main focus
          of attraction to people in Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned above, I visited Maldives a few times. Some of these
          times I would just chill in the hotel, and two of these times I
          decided to go and explore two different rosters, which were matching
          my budget with my colleagues. The first time we visited the Embudu
          Village Resort for a day use, and the second time we went to Meeru
          Island Resort and Spa for an overnight stay.
        </p>
        <p>
          We took the ferry early in the morning to Embudu Village Resort that
          included access to the beach, swimming and snorkeling, and a full
          buffet at lunch. We started by exploring the resort and relaxing on
          the beach for sometime, while some of us went snorkeling. We were
          taking pictures of the amazing view, the seal gulls on the beach, the
          colorful fish that were swimming in the shallow crystal-clear water
          and the tall coconut trees. We hardly felt the presence of local
          people, however if you ever needed them, they suddenly showed up which
          was fantastic. They are considered there and not there at the same
          time, and they are fully aware of what is happening in the location,
          however they will never bother the tourists. This gives the tourists a
          feeling of more privacy and freedom, especially the honeymooners.
        </p>
        <p>
          At lunch time, we got to meet the other tourists who were spending
          nights in the resort, as well as the ones on day trips like us. Lunch
          was kind of a social gathering in an open air buffet on the beach, and
          all the servers were local people who maintained the discreet and
          understated interaction. As I explained above, my personal experience
          with the Maldivian cuisine was not that great, however to some other
          people it might be the opposite. I tried some dishes such as fish
          curry and Garudhiya which is a local fish soup, however I ended up
          going to the dessert section where I ate a lot of tropical fruits such
          as papaya, passion fruit, pineapple and guava.
        </p>
        <p>
          Towards the end of the afternoon, we started packing our belongings to
          take the ferry back to the hotel, and the weather started to get a bit
          gloomy and the skies became a bit gray. We were advised to wait for
          the ferry on time because of the unpredictable weather conditions so
          that we do not miss it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more thing I would like to highlight is the hot sun of Maldives.
          Maldives sits on the equator with extremely high UV rays, people get
          burned very quickly when they just walk for a few minutes under the
          sun, or they go swimming. It is extremely important to pack high
          quality sunscreens for that trip.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Meeru Island Resort and Spa</h1>
        <p>
          The Meeru Island resort experience was kind of different than the
          Embudu Village one, as it was a bigger resort and had a lot of
          varieties and activities to do, we also got to have a sense of
          spending the night time in Maldives there. I would name the Meeru
          resort as a kind of a family or friends’ resort where you can play
          tennis, golf, volleyball on the beach, take boat excursion trips and
          bicycle rides. There is a big fitness center, and billiard game room
          if you are not a fan of spending time under the sun or swimming. There
          is also the Meeru Museum where it tells the history of the start of
          Maldives Tourism industry and the role that Meeru island played in
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The night life at the Meeru Resort is quite vibrant too, there is a
          nightclub and Maldivian cultural night shows on the beach. The
          difference between our stay in this resort and the Embudu Village day
          use one is the night time Bodhu Beru dance and drum show. It is a
          heritage tradition on the beach while people are eating dinner and
          they invite you to dance and play the drums with them under the
          moonlight. My colleagues and I were glad that we did not have to take
          the ferry at the end of the day like my last trip, and that we had the
          whole night to enjoy the Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The local people in this resort are more involved with the tourists as
          there are more visitors there, and lots of families with kids, which
          requires more attention and interaction from the local people's side
          in comparison to the quiet and private resorts.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Islandness in Maldives</h1>
        <p>
          The people of Maldives are very proud of their culture, and you can
          sense that strongly when they interact with tourists. They keep their
          own language, they are always together and they love their island the
          most. The Maldives Independence Day is a very significant event there
          that shows the love of locals to their island. It is a big celebration
          event there with lots of cultural and heritage shows. They are also
          very reserved and they enforce their cultural habits when they want
          to. I remember it happened once when I had Maldives flight during the
          holy month of Ramadan where some restaurants were closed during the
          daylight hours, as people were observing Ramadan and fasting, however
          they are more flexible in private resorts and hotels. They often
          advise tourists before going to Maldives to make sure that their trip
          is not falling during the month of Ramadan in case some activities are
          temporarily stopped because of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being an island, you get to experience vulnerability and isolation in
          Maldives. This happens when sudden cancellations of ferries or flights
          occur due to weather conditions. You get to feel that as well when the
          monsoon season attacks the island. Maldives had a history of Tsunami
          in 2004 that caused major damage and a high number of deaths.
          Islanders there for sure know and experienced the meanings of
          vulnerability, resilience, togetherness and independence as they
          passed through all these events in their history.
