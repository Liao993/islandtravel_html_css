        <h1>Before going to Singapore</h1>
        <p>
          When I used to fly, we used to have this manual that is called: Cabin
          Crew Station Information Manual. It has the important information that
          we have to know about the destinations we were visiting, and we have
          to tell passengers onboard relevant to the places they are landing
          into. The first thing that was really striking to know about Singapore
          is that smoking, chewing gum and CDs are not allowed to be brought in
          Singapore. We actually have to make an announcement of that before
          landing. If customs officials catch any person carrying these items,
          then you would face serious delays, prosecution and of course a huge
          fine, or in some cases non admittance into Singapore. I was quite
          surprised and I was asking my Singaporean colleagues if they miss
          eating chewing gum, and surprisingly they said they definitely do.
          Some of them the first thing they get to do when they go abroad is to
          buy a packet of chewing gum.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other important piece of information is to check the weather in
          Singapore before traveling. Singapore is very warm throughout the
          year, and it is very humid. Basically, all that is needed are light
          summer clothes and footwear. However, as necessary actions just take
          an umbrella and rain shoes, because as they say: when it rains it
          pours

      <div>
        <h1>First Impression that I got When I arrived in Singapore</h1>
        <p>
          I never felt that I’m on an island in Singapore. I can somehow compare
          it to Dubai as it is very diverse and multicultural. It is very
          modern, full of tall skyscrapers, luxurious big shopping malls and it
          is very clean and very safe to go out at any time of the day or night.
          The rhythm of life in Singapore is so fast and so high tech. There are
          people from everywhere, and a lot of foreign expats who are living
          there as well. Singaporeans will never make you feel like a tourist,
          they are actually kind of used to the tourists or foreigners living on
          their island, so it became so hard to differentiate between who is
          coming for tourism or who is living there. It did not bother me at
          all, but for some travelers they like to feel pampered and looked
          after by the native people, such as in Thailand for example. On the
          contrary, in Singapore natives leave you alone and they do not bother
          you at all which was totally fine with me, but I also do understand
          that some tourists expect the opposite.

        <h1>What to do in Singapore?</h1>
        <p>
          Singapore is full of attractions and things to do the whole day and
          and all night. I consider myself lucky because my airline used to book
          us at the Swissotel the Stamford, which is considered in the heart of
          the city, and most of the important attractions are within walking
          distance. Some of the high floor rooms in that hotel have spectacular
          views of Singapore from their balconies.The things you must see before
          leaving Singapore and are within walking distance if you are downtown
          are:
        </p>

        <p>
          1. The Iconic <b>Merlion Statue</b>, which is a statue that has the
          body of the fish and the face of the lion, and it is spouting water
          out of its mouth. It is beautiful to see during the day or during the
          night as they have attractive light effects on it at night time. While
          being there in that location, there is a beautiful park called the
          Merlion park, where you can take a nice stroll across it, and that
          location has a beautiful view where you can spot the well known Marina
          Bay Sands.
        </p>

          alt="twin"
          class="imginwordtwo"
        />
        <p>
          2.<b>The Marina Bay Sands</b>, you can book a night at that hotel to
          enjoy the various facilities or just take a walk around it as you will
          capture nice pictures of its view. Tourists are very attracted to it
          for having the world’s largest casino, and to check out the 3 huge
          towers that are topped with an infinity swimming pool. You only get to
          use the swimming pool, if you have a room booked there which is really
          worth it. When you swim in that pool, you will feel as if you are
          floating and swimming in the sky among the clouds, and you will also
          get to see Singapore from above which is really stunning.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          3. The <b>Clarke Quay District</b>, people usually visit it during the
          night time, as it has an amazing boardwalk by the marina, and it has
          well-known seafood restaurants, where you can try the chili crab dish.
          The chili crab dish is a must if you are a seafood lover, where they
          take it out of big aquariums and cook it freshly for you. They are
          open till very late at night too.

        <p>
          Some of the tourist sites require that you book them in advance, as
          they are not located downtown, however they are worth visiting. You
          have to go way earlier before opening times because waiting queues are
          too long and they take time, whether you start your visit, or at the
          end when you wait for transport to get back. The ones in my opinion
          that are worth visiting are:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. <b>Sentosa Island</b> is a resort that has a lot of water sports
          activities on man-made beaches off the coast of Singapore. It has an
          aquarium, golf courses and theme parks if you like to enjoy rides. It
          is kind of similar to Sun City in Johannesburg in South Africa which
          is also worth visiting in my opinion.

          class="imginwordtwo"
        />
        <p>
          2. <b>Jurong Bird Park</b> is a park that has plenty of bird species
          where you can enjoy watching shows with the birds in open areas in the
          park. It is a perfect place to visit for families with kids. You also
          get to take pictures with parrots, and get the chance to view the
          penguins.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          3. <b>Singapore Zoo</b> is so far the place I liked the most in
          Singapore. It stands out from the rest because you can visit it as a
          zoo at day time, to enjoy the wildlife creatures, and also you can
          come one more time at night time to do a night safari, which is very
          thrilling and exciting. The zoo has trains, and hiking trails to spot
          the elephants, tigers, leopards and many other animals to see and feel
          the excitement about
        </p>
        <p>
          4. <b>The Universal Studios Singapore</b>, it is a movie amusement
          park with Hollywood themes and rides, and some live shows that happen
          there at theaters. This is another fun place to visit for people with
          families and kids.

        <h1>Districts Worth Visiting in Singapore</h1>
        <p>
          Since Singapore is a multicultural and cosmopolitan destination, you
          find districts that represent communities there, such as:
          <b>Little India</b>. It is a very colorful neighborhood, where it has
          a lot of Indian temples especially during the Diwali celebration,
          traditional Indian markets where you can buy silk and jewelry and lots
          of Indian cuisine restaurants. There is also another district called:
          Chinatown. <b>Chinatown</b> reflects the ethnic background roots of
          Singapore's Chinese culture. There are lots of heritage museums there,
          and plenty of Chinese food options to try from, as Chinese food there
          is very popular. It is like open traditional fares of Chinese
          restaurants where people get to indulge in eating noodles, fried rice,
          satay and Hainanese chicken rice. Last but not least is the: Arab
          Street. I visited the Arab Street quite often and I think the reason
          is that I am an Arab myself, and also due to the fact that I’m a picky
          eater. Once you step with your foot into the <b>Arab street</b>, you
          will feel like you are in the Middle East all of a sudden. It is full
          of shops that have Lebanese, Syrian, Egyptian, Iraqi, Palestinian and
          many other Arab country cuisines. There are a lot of Arabs that visit
          Singapore every year, and especially from the Gulf countries. I used
          to meet some of the passengers in that street who were with me on the
          flight from Abu Dhabi to Singapore, or would fly with me from
          Singapore back to Abu Dhabi, and they would tell me on the flight that
          they saw me there last night.

        <h1>Islandness in Singapore</h1>
        <p>
          I find it extremely difficult to feel or incorporate the concept of
          Islandness and all the meanings that it carries while being in
          Singapore. I went there several times, and each time I did not feel
          that I’m on an island. The feeling it gave me was that of being in a
          modern city, very well advanced and developed. I could not feel the
          sense of being surrounded by water, or being on the edge or periphery.
          I could not feel isolation, resilience or separation. I also could not
          relate there to the concept of sun, sea and sand, as it is full of
          modern tall buildings, companies and shopping malls, which all make it
          difficult to reflect on the idea of islandness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people of Singapore are very diverse, you can find Indian
          Singaporeans, Malay Singaporeans and Chinese Singaporeans. Together
          with the large number of tourists and foreigners living over there, it
          gives you the feeling of more of a city than of an island. There, you
          do not get to feel the difference between natives, tourists or expats.
          Also, most of the people who visit Singapore go there by planes and
          not by ferries or boats. This is my own personal view of course, and
          I’m not criticizing Singapore or anything, in fact I loved going there
          so much during those flights I had there. It is just very different,
          to me it is a lively, vibrant industrial city that reflects the fast
          modern pace of life that we currently have nowadays in the mainland.
