        <h1>Colorful history to make diverse cultures</h1>
        <p>
          When it comes to Taiwan, we need to start from its history Taiwan,
          located in the western Pacific Ocean, has had a strong strategic
          position since the 1600s. In 1624, Dutch occupied the south of Taiwan
          for 38 years until the general Zheng took over Tainan in 1662. Taiwan
          has been under Chinese sovereignty for more than 200 years since
          General Zheng's occupation, and a huge number of Chinese have
          relocated from China to Taiwan during that time. They contributed
          significantly to Taiwan's early population. The Qing dynasty, the
          government that ruled Taiwan at the time, was defeated by Japan in
          1894. As a result, Japan colonized Taiwan for 50 years till the end of
          World War II. Following that, Taiwan was returned to the Republic of
          China. However, the government of the Republic of China was defeated
          in the Chinese civil war, and the Chinese rule was taken over by Mao
          Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. As a result, the
          government of the Republic of China relocated to Taiwan, and a large
          number of Chinese citizens came to Taiwan at the time, resulting in
          another significant increase in Taiwanese population. Furthermore, the
          political situation in Taiwan is remains complicated as a result of
          the civil war and the United States' subsequent policy of deliberate
          ambiguity. The conflict between the Community Party of China and the
          Republic of China (Taiwan) government remains unresolved.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the prospect of returning to mainland China and regaining power
          dwindling, the government of the Republic of China began to focus its
          attention on this small island. Therefore, Taiwan's economic growth
          has accelerated. Taiwan also became a democratic country during this
          time period. Since 1990s, another group of people start to move into
          Taiwan, due to labor shortage, Taiwan started to welcome people from
          Southeast Asia to work in Taiwan since 1990s. More and more
          Vietnamese, Filipinos, Thai, and Indonesian came to Taiwan in these
          recent two decades. They brought their cultures, especially cuisines
          to Taiwan and made Taiwan became more and more diverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the majority of Taiwan's population is Chinese, due to its
          openness and unique geographical location, Taiwan has evolved into a
          vibrant and culturally rich country after 400 years. From above
          history, we already known Taiwan is a country with diverse cultures.
          Besides, I will share the islandness of Taiwan from different
          perspectives.

        <h1>Dutch cultures</h1>
        <p>
          The Dutch had a significant influence on Taiwan during their colonial
          rule from 1624 to 1662. Their impact on the island's culture,
          language, and architecture can still be seen today. One of the most
          significant contributions the Dutch made to Taiwan was in the area of
          agriculture. They introduced new crops such as sugar cane, which
          became a major export for Taiwan. The Dutch also brought with them new
          farming techniques, which helped to increase crop yields and improve
          the island's agricultural production. The Dutch also left a lasting
          impact on Taiwan's architecture. They built forts, churches, and
          government buildings in a distinctive European style that blended
          Dutch and local influences. Some of these structures, such as Fort
          Zeelandia in Tainan, still stand today and are popular tourist
          attractions. Tainan, the city in the south of Taiwan, was a stronghold
          during the Dutch colonial period. Therefore, most of Taiwanese viewed
          Tainan as the beginning of Taiwanese history and the oldest city in
          Taiwan. Because of this reason, I chose to study in Tainan for my
          bachelor’s degree.

      <div>
        <h1>Chinese cultures and Religions</h1>
        <p>
          Fujian and Hakka immigrants began arriving in Taiwan in the 17th
          century, shaping the island's history and cultural landscape. My
          ancestors immigrated from China at this time, and thus I would say my
          blood is Fujian culture. One of the most significant contributions of
          Fujian culture to Taiwan is in the area of food. Taiwanese cuisine has
          been heavily influenced by Fujian cuisine, with dishes like braised
          pork rice and oyster omelet being popular examples. The use of
          ingredients like soy sauce, rice wine, and fermented tofu in Taiwanese
          cooking also has its roots in Fujian cuisine. Those food are easy to
          be found in night market. The Hakka people, known for their
          industriousness and resilience, have also made significant
          contributions to Taiwanese cultures. Hakka architecture is also a
          prominent feature of Taiwan's cultural landscape. Hakka houses, which
          are typically round or rectangular in shape, are designed to be both
          functional and defensive. These houses are built using rammed earth
          and have thick walls to protect against invaders and natural
          disasters. Many Hakka houses still stand today and have become popular
          tourist attractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to food and architecture, the Fujian and Hakka cultures
          have also brought their religion when immigrated to Taiwan. One of the
          most significant Chinese religions brought to Taiwan was Buddhism.
          Chinese Buddhist monks and nuns arrived in Taiwan to spread their
          teachings and establish monasteries. These monks and nuns played a
          significant role in shaping Taiwanese Buddhism, adapting it to the
          local culture and customs. Taoism, another Chinese religion, was also
          introduced to Taiwan through migration and cultural exchange.
          Taiwanese Taoism, also known as "folk Taoism," incorporates indigenous
          beliefs and practices into its teachings and rituals, creating a
          unique blend of Taoism and local traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temples are the most distinguished things to explain Taiwan religious
          cultures. There are more than 15,000 official temples in Taiwan.
          Temples are not only a place to worship gods and goddesses but also a
          community center to interact with others. Once in a while, there will
          be temple fairs for celebration of gods’ or goddesses’ birthday. At
          this moment, you will see a bunch of people walking on the street,
          playing Chinese instruments, and dressed in puppets of gods. All kinds
          of decorated trucks follow this parade, and sometimes there will be
          hot girls dancing and singing on the trucks to invigorate the party.
          Temple fairs are full of colorful and interesting things to explore.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1>Japanese cultures</h1>
        <p>
          There is a significant presence of Japanese culture in Taiwan, largely
          due to Japan's colonization of the island from 1895 to 1945. During
          this period, Japan introduced its language, education system,
          infrastructure, and cultural practices to Taiwan. One of the most
          noticeable aspects of Japanese culture in Taiwan is its architecture.
          Many buildings in Taiwan were built during the Japanese colonial
          period and reflect the Japanese influence in their design. One of the
          notable examples is our presidential palace. Also, most of modern
          sugar factories in Taiwan were built by Japanese. Therefore, it is
          easy to find some Japanese style dormitories while walking in sugar
          factories. The other aspect of Japanese culture in Taiwan is its food.
          Many Japanese dishes have become popular in Taiwan, such as sushi,
          ramen, and tempura. There are also many Japanese restaurants in
          Taiwan, including high-end sushi restaurants and casual ramen shops.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Mountains and Ocean</h1>
        <p>
          Besides diverse culture, the landscapes of Taiwan is breathtaking.
          Over 70 percentage of landscapes in Taiwan are mountains. Therefore, I
          would say Taiwanese has strong relationships to mountains. Since I was
          a high school student, my parents took me to Forest Recreation Area or
          National Park every weekend. This made me enjoy the lifestyles to
          immerse into nature. The feeling to be with mother nature is hard to
          describe, I just shared my pictures to show my enjoyment in mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ocean is another connection for a person from islands. One of my
          favorite things is to watch sunset at beach. When I was studying in
          Tainan, the place where I live is really close to the beach.
          Therefore, I usually went to watch sunset from time to time. Listening
          to the sound of waves also made me peaceful, and this is why I like to
          see on the beach alone. I always feel I am recharged after watching
          sunset and I can have more energy to keep fighting with my exams after
          supper.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Democracy</h1>
        <p>
          I will say democracy play a critical role in Taiwanese islandness. The
          first steps towards democracy in Taiwan came in the 1980s when the
          government began to relax its authoritarian grip on society. In 1987,
          martial law was lifted, and the government allowed opposition parties
          to form. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was founded in 1986
          and quickly became the leading opposition party. In 1996, Lee Teng-hui
          was elected from the first direct presidential election. After that,
          Taiwan has a presidential election every four years, and has
          experienced several political party rotations in the past two decades.
          From now on, Taiwan a mature democratic country in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason why I will say democracy play a critical role in Taiwanese
          islandness is it strengthens the identity of Taiwanese. Because of
          complicated situation and history, Taiwan has a strong relationship
          with China. However, because of democracy, Taiwan is different from
          China. The people living in Taiwan have the right to create, to speak,
          and to decide their own future. Because of democracy, Taiwan becomes
          the most free and open region in the Chinese society, and because of
          democracy, Taiwanese has stronger identity of the island where they
          live and are proud to be Taiwanese.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1>Islandness of Taiwan</h1>
        <p>
          For me, the islandness of Taiwan is simple. Diverse cultures,
          delicious and various food, mountains, ocean and democracy.
