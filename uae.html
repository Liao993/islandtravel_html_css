        <h1>Artificial Islands in the United Arab Emirates</h1>
        <p>
          I used to live in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for 15 years and a
          half, during my flying career. However, I had a previous experience
          living in a gulf country before moving to the UAE, and that was Saudi
          Arabia as I was born there. There are 6 gulf countries and they have
          some kind of similarities and yet some differences as well. They are
          all close to each other, you can fly in and out of one and go to the
          next in a maximum of approximately an hour and 10 minutes. The climate
          is very hot in those 6 countries during the summer, and they usually
          have very long summer months which are around late March to the end of
          October, and the period between end of October to late March is very
          pleasant, and tourists are advised to go there during that time.

        <h1>One the way to The Isle of Skye</h1>
        <p>
          9 a.m., We left Edinburgh to begin our highland journey, and we are
          scheduled to arrive in the evening on the Isle of Skye. I could image
          this will be a long with the weather getting worse and worse. I was
          expecting three days of rain on our highland expedition.
          Unsurprisingly, the sky has changed from blue to grey since we left
          Edinburgh. The rain became heavier as we travelled. My mood is easy to
          be influenced by the weather, and thus I thought I won’t be excited on
          my highland trip, but I still tried to make myself enjoy every moment
          during the trip. The rain didn’t stop for around six hours, and thus I
          guessed the weather of the Isle of Skye would be worse. What’s more, I
          didn’t sleep well last night, so I thought I would fall asleep while
          arriving the hotel. Surprisingly, since we arrived Fort William, the
          largest city before going to the Isle of Skye. The blue sky started to
          say hello and welcome us. Interestingly, I became excited again and
          looked forward to the days on the Isle of Skye. After 90 minutes ride,
          we finally arrived the Isle of Skye, and the weather was sunny as
          expected. We also got an opportunity to watch sunset when we arrived
          Portree, the largest city on the Isle of Skye. How lucky we were!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          The gulf countries are very rich countries because they have had a lot
          of oil since the day they discovered it there, so the lifestyle there
          is very comfortable and easy. A lot of expats are living there because
          of the great job opportunities and income they provide. Since these
          countries are very rich and the majority of their countries consist of
          huge desert areas, they aim to use that huge desert space and turn it
          into big luxurious projects. They also do reclaimed sand projects to
          build huge artificial islands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not going to talk about the dangers of artificial islands or the
          consequences of sand reclamation here, as during that time I was not
          aware of the negative aspects of these things to the environment and
          to the ecosystem. I started to be more knowledgeable about these
          things when I started my island studies program later on in Prince
          Edward Island. Therefore, I will talk about why people are attracted
          to these islands and what is on them, and also what the tourists can
          do there. I got the chance to visit two of these islands while I was
          living there; the Palm Jumeirah and the Bluewaters Island, and they
          are both in Dubai. I used to live in the capital city Abu Dhabi,
          however to go to Dubai you only need around an hour and 15 minutes
          drive to get there.

        <h1>Palm Jumeirah</h1>
        <p>
          Palm Jumeirah is very famous because it is shaped like a palm tree
          when viewed from the top, which makes it an iconic artificial island.
          It is kind of a resort island where it has a lot of luxury resort
          hotels, upscale restaurants, posh residential houses and the Jumeirah
          boardwalk. You can describe it as an island that has all the
          recreational and entertainment facilities that could be enjoyed if one
          was alone, with friends or with families. There is always something
          fun to do there. It is best advised as I mentioned above to visit
          there from late October to the end of March to be able to enjoy the
          outdoor facilities such as dining outdoors, walking on the boardwalk
          or swimming in the beach.

        <h1>Things to do while being on Palm Jumeirah Island</h1>
        <p>
          Atlantis the Palm, a visit to this famous hotel resort is a must
          there. Atlantis is a famous brand name hotel series that are located
          in Bahamas, China and Dubai. They have Aqua-venture water theme park
          which is a fun adventure for the whole family, and also you can visit
          the Lost Chambers Aquarium, where you can explore the mythical
          legendary lost city of Atlantis, among a lot of marine species and
          shipwreck remains. Atlantis the Palm has plenty of dining options that
          suit all the tastes. You can also relax and sunbathe at the White
          Beach there if you just like to sit down, and soak up the sun and
          chill
        </p>
        <p>
          Skydiving, if you are adventurous enough, and a big fan of extreme
          thrills, I would advise you to book a skydiving day, where you get to
          jump out of the sky with a professional, and see the spectacular view
          of palm Jumeirah from the top. Your package will include photographs
          and filmed video of your jumping memorable adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water sports, there are plenty of water sports that you can do on Palm
          Jumeirah, such as: Standup Paddle-board tours, Kayak tours & Windsurf
          Lesson tours. While being on these water sport tours, you get to enjoy
          the stunning views of Dubai’s different skylines, and seeing the
          beaches of the different resorts while being in the water doing your
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jumeirah Boardwalk, if you visit Dubai during the winter months, do
          not miss to take a walk or go for a run on the Jumeirah Boardwalk. It
          is very enjoyable being there and very relaxing, and it is free of
          charge. You can go anytime during the day, however most people love to
          go during the magical sunset time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hop on & Hop Off Bus Tours, this tour is recommended for first timers
          in Dubai in general, it kind of gives an introduction about Dubai and
          how it is structured. You can hop off at any of its stations if you
          would like to take some pictures, or explore some of the surroundings,
          and then hop on the bus again to continue your trip. It has a
          narration recorded in many languages, that describes the sites and
          locations while you are on the bus through using headphones. The top
          of the bus is formed of glass in case you visit Dubai during the
          summer, and you would be able to take pictures clearly through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Palm Monorail Visit, the best way to navigate through Palm
          Jumeirah's favorite spots is through taking the Palm Monorail. It has
          scenic views of the palm and its station stops. It has several stops
          and you can take the monorail and hop on and off in all of them to
          discover them all, or you can also go to a specific location on the
          island.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Bluewaters Island</h1>
        <p>
          The other man-made island that I got to visit in Dubai is: Bluewaters
          Islands. It is kind of similar in its idea to Palm Jumeirah of having
          upscale hotels, top notch restaurants and Luxury residential areas,
          however it is more urban and more modern than it. You can visit
          Bluewaters Island by driving there or taking a taxi. If you are a fan
          of exploring the place through walking, then you can do so by crossing
          the big pedestrian link bridge that connects Bluewaters Island to
          Jumeirah Beach Residence location. In my opinion, I see a lot of
          attraction resemblance between London city in England and Bluewaters
          Island in Dubai.

        <h1>Things to do while being on Bluewaters Island</h1>

          Ain Dubai, similar to London's iconic London Eye, you can take a ride
          at Ain Dubai where you get to enjoy viewing the entire city from high
          up. The view is amazing whether it is during the day or during the
          night time. At night you get to see how Dubai’s city lighting is
          glistening among the dark. Ain means Eye in Arabic, which is basically
          the translation of Dubai Eye, same as London Eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Madame Tussaud’s Dubai, you get to visit your famous celebrities at
          the museum and take pictures with them, they look real even though
          they are made of wax. This is another attraction that also exists in
          London apart from Ain Dubai.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caesars Palace Hotel & the Cove Beach, If you are a sun lover, then
          you have to head to the Cove Beach and enjoy a relaxing lazy day
          there. They have a fresh seafood restaurant there called Two.0 where
          you can indulge in fresh seafood dishes. They also have big swimming
          pools there if you prefer pools than beaches. The beach is located at
          the Caesars Palace Hotel at Bluewaters Island, the second to the
          famous Caesars Palace Hotel that is located in Las Vegas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bluewaters Island Wharf Retail Shops & Restaurants, you can have an
          amazing shopping spree at the various shops and boutiques located at
          the wharf of Bluewaters Island. There are also many restaurants and
          coffee shops. The walk on the wharf is pleasant during the winter
          season as it is outdoors, however the shops and restaurants are air
          conditioned with outdoor seating areas as well.

        <h1>Islandness on the Artificial Islands of Dubai</h1>
        <p>
          In those artificial islands in Dubai, I never felt that I’m on an
          actual island if I’m going to compare it to Maldives or Boracay for
          instance. It is kind of more like Singapore; urban and modern places
          with lots of technology and luxury. A lot of people might criticize
          places such as the UAE or Singapore as being artificial and without a
          soul. I think you would form a bond or connection with such kinds of
          places only if you were born and brought up in a similar environment,
          or if you tend to be attracted to modern things in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider my case as one of those examples, especially in relation to
          the gulf countries, if not Singapore. Saudi Arabia, United Arab
          Emirates and Bahrain will always have a piece of my heart for each one
          of them. I just love them, and feel so safe and comfortable living in
          them. I do not mind one day if I go back and live in any of them one
          more time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also do understand the point of view of people who visit them for
          the first time and say they are artificial, they actually have a point
          in that. First of all they are man-made islands, and no comparison
          when it comes to real natural islands. Secondly, feelings of
          separation, periphery, isolation, separation are hard to be felt there
          because they do not exist in the first place in Palm Jumeirah or
          Bluewater islands. There, there are only tourists from different parts
          of the world having fun under the sun, and then they leave and another
          set of tourists arrive, and so on and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I call UAE a place that has miniatures of the rest of the world's
          attractions in it. People always refer to Dubai and say that Dubai is
          a different planet. There is even a song in Arabic by a famous Saudi
          Singer that has the title of: Dubai is a different Planet. It is
          definitely worth visiting and worth exploring, and then forming your
          own opinion about it.
