          Hello, my name is Rabab, I am from Egypt and welcome to my islands’
          adventures. Before coming to Prince Edward Island, I used to be a
          flight attendant for 15 and a half years. I had the opportunity to
          visit some warm water tropical islands back then. I’m going to share
          my personal experience about those islands here on this website, as
          well as some of the photos that I managed to capture and I still have
          access to. Prince Edward Island is considered the very first cold
          water island experience to me which I’m also going to talk about.
          Currently, I’m doing a Master of Arts in Island Studies at the
          University of Prince Edward Island, and I met my classmate Henry in
          this course who also visited a lot of wonderful islands. Henry, as
          well, will share his insight into some of his amazing trips, and we
          are both creating the website for this purpose. Our objective is to
          build a website that will talk about the islands we have been to, and
          the concept of Islandness from our own point of view and our personal
          travel encounters.
